GUI Assignment: Creating an Interactive Dynamic Table

Meet Kothari, UMass Lowell Computer Science, meet_kothari@student.uml.edu

The sources I used for my code are embedded as they're used; the most important ones to mention, I think,
are 

1) https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/forms/ - the BS documentation for creating forms
2) source (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Oq6Eqy7Y_A&t=749s&ab_channel=Divotips) - a video that showed the process for creating a string an appending a table in it

The rest of my sources are cited as used.
