# This is the submission for Part 2 of HW4. All of my sources are embedded in the code.

I believe my degree of success for this assignment is ~90%:

• (6) page exhibits two-way binding between each slider and its corresponding text field- yes, my assignment does this.

• (6) table updates dynamically when either the slider is changed or a new text value is entered- my form auto-updates when given a new value

• (6) page implements the jQuery UI tabbed interface- kind of, the only issue is, my table doesn't always save perfectly

• (3) individual tabs can be deleted- you can specify which tab you'd like to delete

• (3) multiple tabs can be deleted simultaneously- you can choose to delete all of the tabs if you'd like
