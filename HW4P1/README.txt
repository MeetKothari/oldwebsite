This is the submission for Part 1 of HW4. All of my sources are embedded in the code.

I believe my degree of success for this assignment is 100%:

(4) validation is accomplished using the jQuery Validation plugin - I used the plugin, it's visible in my JS file.

(4) error messages are precise and relevant and helpful to the user- Each error describes precisely why the input is not allowed.

(4) error messages are positioned reasonably and direct the user to the error location- All error messages are positioned next to the invalid field.

(2) error messages suggest how to correct the error- All error messages provide clarity on how to fix the error.

(2) page does not reload if there is an error in the entered parameters- My page doesn't reload when given an error. It stays until the error is rectified.
